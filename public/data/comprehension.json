    "text": "Jamal borrowed his sister\u2019s bike to visit a friend across town. The sky was grey, but he thought the clouds would pass. Halfway there, the rain began, pattering first, then heavily. Jamal stopped under a tree and rang his friend to say he would be late. When the rain eased, he continued slowly, avoiding puddles and slick leaves. By the time he arrived, the sun had found its way through the clouds.",
